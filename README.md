# Vertical Sample Holder/PID Heater
A homemade PID heater built so as to not impede access to a vertically-held sample for fluorescence thermometry calibration.

The vertical sample holder was built to replace a previous iteration which consisted of a vertical copper bar sitting on a hot plate. The previous copper bar had significant temperature variation both across the sample face, as well as depending on the air flow patterns set up bu the hot plate on any particular day. as well, it was 100 percent manual and required entering the room and potentially bumping the sample while adjusting the set temperature.
